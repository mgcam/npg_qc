=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 criterion

Criterion that was used to evaluate a pass/fail for this check.

=cut
sub criterion {
    return q[The value of the third quartile is larger than the lower boundary of the expected size];
};


=head2 quartiles

A string representation of the quartile array or undef

=cut
sub quartiles {
  my $self = shift;
  my $result = undef;
  if ($self->quartile1) {
    $result =  $self->quartile1 . q[ ] . $self->median . q[ ] . $self->quartile3;
  }
  return $result;
}


=head2 percent_well_aligned_reads

Percent of well-aligned reads or undef

=cut
sub percent_well_aligned_reads {
  my ($self, $opp_dir) = @_;
  my $method = q[num_well_aligned_reads];
  if ($opp_dir) {
    $method .= q[_opp_dir];
  }
  return defined $self->$method ? round($self->$method/$self->sample_size * $HUNDRED) : undef;
}


=head2 expected_size_range

A string representation of the insert size range or undef

=cut
sub expected_size_range {
  my $self = shift;

  my $expected_size;
  if ($self->expected_mean) {
    $expected_size = $self->expected_mean;
  } elsif ($self->expected_size) {
    my $min = min @{$self->expected_size};
    my $max = max @{$self->expected_size};
    if ($min == $max) {
      $expected_size = $min;
    } else {
      $expected_size = join q[:], $min, $max;
    }
  }
  return $expected_size;
