=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 normalised_contamination

    Normalise the raw contaminant counts by dividing by the total number of
    reads and multiplying by a factor that accounts for how much of the
    organism's genome is represented in the reference sequence. Return a
    hashref with the organism names as keys.

=head2 ranked_organisms

    Sort the organisms represented in the reference sequence by descending
    order of their normalised contamination values. Return this list as an
    array reference.
